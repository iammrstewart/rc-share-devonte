  <h1>Change promised in Walsh hiring</h1>
  <h2>Hiring lags racial diversity</h2>
    <hr></hr>
  <h3>By June Pattison-Gordon</h3>
    <hr></hr>
 <p>Two years in, some struggle to point to what the creation of a diversity officer has done for the Walsh administration's efforts to diversify city jobs.</p>
 <p>While Walsh touted plans to increase diversity, former city councilor Charles Yancey, who made monitoring diversity in city hiring one focus area of his work, said little progress has been seen so far.</p>
 <p>This administration has had very disappointing misses in diversity," he told the Banner.</p>
 <p>Marta  Rivera, a coordinator at the Greater Boston Latino Network, noted that the mayor missed a chance to directly increase diversity when he handpicked his cabinet.  </p>
 <p>We latinos are not even close to being represented in city government," Rivera told the Banner.</p>
 <p>Greater Boston Latino network's 2014 report on the paucity of Latinos in city government positions spurred the creation of the diversity officer position.</p>
 <p>Rivera said that while establishing that role is a positive step, the GBLN has not experienced greater transparency from the hiring office or communication about job openings.</p>
